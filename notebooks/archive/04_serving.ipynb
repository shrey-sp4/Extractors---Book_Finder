The text enables future managers and technical professionals to better understand and appreciate each other's perspective in the network design process. Network managers will need a sound grounding in basic design principles to effectively manage, plan, and assess the plethora of new technologies and equipment available for designing networks. They also must understand how requirements should be formulated and specified for design engineers. Similarly, network designers and engineers need a sound grounding in basic management principles to fully understand how organizational requirements best reflect design recommendations. Network Design enables network management and design professionals to work together toward achieving their respective goals in the network design process. It outlines basic techniques; reviews major challenges and issues; summarizes prevailing approaches and technologies; describes the specification, design, and planning data network topologies; and assesses specification and evaluation processes in designing and implementing data networks. This excellent, unique resource also : Emphasizes principles and analytical approaches that work independent of specific implementation of technology Includes case studies to illustrate how basic principles can be applied to realistic network design problems, considering both technical and management considerations Demystifies the design process, describing the lingua franca of both managers and design engineers in common terms Provides a better understanding of the total network design process\"}, {'title': 'Workflow Management Systems for Process Organizations', 'author': 'Schael, Thomas', 'year': 1998.0, 'edition': None, 'publisher': 'New York: Springer-Verlag,', 'isbn': '354065304X', 'description': '\"This book introduces the perspective of customer-driven and teamwork-oriented process organisation. Its aim is to design and test concepts of Computer Supported Cooperative Work, especially concepts for workflow management systems, in order to fundamentally improve business processes in enterprises. Its methodological approach to analysis and design of cooperative networks is a response to shortcomings of current support systems and misunderstandings about cooperative work and team-based organisations. Several different commercial workflow management systems are presented and distinguished in terms of their main characteristics. Novel kinds of business process analysis are proposed, leading to interesting new combinations of information and cooperation technologies. The book not only presents ways to get around the pitfalls resulting from a naive use of these technologies, but also identifies design guidelines and critical success factors.\"--PUBLISHER\\'S WEBSITE.'}, {'title': 'Conceptual modeling : current issues and future directions', 'author': 'Chen, Peter P.', 'year': 1999.0, 'edition': None, 'publisher': 'Berlin: Springer,', 'isbn': '9.78354E+12', 'description': \"This volume contains a collection of selected papers presented at the Symposium on Conceptual Modeling, which was held in Los Angeles, California, on December 2, th 1997, immediately before the 16 International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER'97), which was held at UCLA. A total of eighteen papers were selected for inclusion in this volume. These papers are written by experts in the conceptual modeling area and represent the most current thinking of these experts. This volume also contains the summaries of three workshops that were held on 6 7 December 1997, immediately after the ER'97 conference at UCLA. The topics of these three workshops are: â\\x80¢ Behavioral Modeling â\\x80¢ Conceptual Modeling in Multimedia Information Seeking â\\x80¢ What Is the Role of Cognition in Conceptual Modeling? Since these topics are not only very important but also very timely, we think it is appropriate to include the summary of these three workshops in this volume. Those readers interested in further investigating topics related to the three workshops can either look up the individual paper published on the Web or contact the authors directly. The summary paper by Chen at the beginning of this volume also includes the summary of several interesting speeches at the Symposium.\"}, {'title': 'Computer-Supported Cooperative Work : introduction to distributed applications', 'author': 'Borghoff, Uwe M.', 'year': 2000.0, 'edition': None, 'publisher': 'New York: Springer-Verlag,', 'isbn': '3540669841', 'description': 'A detailed introduction to interdisciplinary application area of distributed systems, namely the computer support of individuals trying to solve a problem in cooperation with each other but not necessarily having identical work places or working times.

The approach to producing interactive multimedia mapping products is quite unique and there has been an upsurge of interest in developing methodologies that best exploit both the technology and communication effectiveness of multimedia mapping. This book is addressed to professional cartographers interested in moving into multimedia mapping, for cartographers already involved in this field who wish to discover the approaches that other practioners in multimedia cartography have already taken and for students and academics in the mapping sciences and related geographic fields wishing to update their knowledge of cartographic design and production.'}]\n"
